To set up a simple example of using GraphQL in a React Native application, you'll need to follow these steps:

Set up a React Native project.
Install the necessary dependencies for GraphQL.
Create a basic GraphQL server (or use a public GraphQL endpoint).
Fetch data from the GraphQL server in your React Native app.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieving this:


Using React Native CLI:
npx react-native init GraphQLExample
cd GraphQLExample
npx react-native start

Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies for GraphQL. This includes apollo-client, apollo-cache-inmemory, apollo-link-http, and react-apollo.
npm install @apollo/client graphql

For simplicity, we’ll use a public GraphQL API. In this example, we'll use the Countries GraphQL API.
'https://countries.trevorblades.com/',

Explanation
Apollo Client Setup:

We initialize the Apollo Client with the URI of the GraphQL server and an in-memory cache.
GraphQL Query:

We define a GraphQL query to fetch the list of countries, including their code, name, and emoji.
CountriesList Component:

We use the useQuery hook from Apollo to fetch data based on the GET_COUNTRIES query.
If the data is loading, we show a loading text. If there's an error, we display the error message.
Once data is fetched, we display the list of countries using a FlatList.
App Component:

We wrap our main component with ApolloProvider and pass the client to it.
Inside the main view, we display a title and the CountriesList component.
This simple example demonstrates how to integrate GraphQL into a React Native application using Apollo Client. You can extend this by adding more queries, mutations, and handling different states more gracefully.
